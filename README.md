# Manrrikflix
To avoid copyright issues, the name of this website has been changed to Manrrikflix. The repository contains the initial interface of the website, developed solely using CSS files to replicate the user selection screen of Netflix. This interface is the only feature implemented on the website, and there are no additional pages or functionalities. The design is responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes.
You can access the website at: https://manrrikflix.vercel.app/

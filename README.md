# Manrrikflix
To avoid copyright issues, the name of this website has been changed to Manrrikflix. The initial interface was developed using only CSS files and aims to replicate the appearance of the user selection screen on Netflix. The website features a black background with the Manrrikflix logo at the top and circular profile icons for each available user in the center of the page. Each icon has a white border and the username below. Hovering over the icon turns the border red and highlights the username in white. When selecting a user, a "Continue" button appears below the profiles. The design is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
